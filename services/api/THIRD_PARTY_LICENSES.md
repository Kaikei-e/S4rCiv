# Third-Party Licenses

The `services/api` Go module bundles the third-party components below. The S4RCIV
server body is **AGPL-3.0**; every component here is under a permissive license
**compatible with AGPL-3.0**, with attribution retained as required. (Researched and
recorded per ADR-000008 / the M4 voter-name segmentation work, 2026-06-03.)

## Japanese morphological analyzer (voter-name segmentation)

Used only to segment free-text 記名投票 rosters in `internal/domain/legislative`
(`vote_names.go`); the structured 選挙区 field stays on a deterministic parser.

## Go supplementary libraries

| Component | Version | License | Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| `golang.org/x/net` (`/html`) | v0.30.0 | **BSD-3-Clause** (© The Go Authors) | HTML table parsing of the 両院公式議員名簿 (giin-roster gateway). |

## AGPL-3.0 compatibility conclusion

MIT and BSD-3-Clause are permissive and one-way compatible into AGPL-3.0. MeCab-IPADIC
is a permissive BSD-style license whose only obligations (retain copyright + NO
WARRANTY notice) are satisfied by this file plus the bundled `COPYING`. No copyleft
obligation conflicts with the AGPL-3.0 server body.
